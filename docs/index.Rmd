knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Covid Report
I will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. This was all calculated in the `analysis.R` file which has been sourced. You can visualize the cases
in the plot below.

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
